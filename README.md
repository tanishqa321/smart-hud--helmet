Motorcycle riding is a popular and enjoyable activity, but it also poses
many risks and challenges for the riders. One of the main challenges is
the lack of information and communication while riding, which can
affect the rider’s safety, convenience, and comfort. For example, the
rider may need to look away from the road to check the speedometer,
the navigation system, or the phone, which can cause distraction and
accidents.
The Heads-Up Display (HUD) helmet is a product of the convergence of
various technologies, such as augmented reality, artificial intelligence,
internet of things, and wearable devices. Smart Heads-Up Display (HUD)
helmets are helmets that have a Heads-Up Display (HUD) that shows
information such as speed, navigation, phone calls, music, and rearview camera in the rider’s field of vision. In this project We integrated
modern technology into the current helmets to make it safer, better and
more reliable on roads.
